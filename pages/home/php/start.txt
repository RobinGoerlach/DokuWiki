  *  [[https://apachefriends.org/|XAMPP]]/MAMP/WAMP are all in one solution products, bundling preconfigured web server (Apache), PHP, database (MySQL/MariaDB) and useful tools (phpmyadmin). Alternatively use Docker or Virtual Machines, or install Apache, MySQL, PHP and phpmyadmin one by one.
    * The installation of [[https://apachefriends.org/|XAMPP]] & Co is simple but does not support instilling multiple PHP versions at the same time out of the box. Not multiple MySQL Version, Difficult to maintain multiple projects
    * Its not suited for production due to security. 
    * "Works on my machine" with differing configuration between local setup and production. Differences could bin minor if you know what you are doing, or could be major like different versions in PHP or MySQL. Different in installed packages what end in "it works on my local machine but not in production. Using [[https://apachefriends.org/|XAMPP]] & Co is absolutely okay for getting things running fast or hobby projects and playing around with PHP. 
  * Download [[http://laragon.org|Laragon]] full a all in one solution for Windows only with Cmder, MySQL, HeidiSQL and Apache as a modern light way solution

Try [[http://localhost/dashboard/|XAMPP Dashboard]] to see if installation is working. Delete the content of htdocs or create a directory below htdocs and create a index.php file there.

==== Virtual Machines or Docker Solution ====

===== Using PHP =====
You need to run PHP from the command line, if you plan using a semi professional PHP development environment. You can do this using the command line application on your computer. For example PowerShell in Windows or Terminal on Mac and Linux. The simplest way to check, if you can run PHP on the command line is to run this command.
<code bash>
php -v 
</code>
This will confirm that you can run PHP on the command line and tell you which version you have installed. 

Run a PHP Script
<code bash>
php index.php
php -S localhost:8000 
php -S localhost:8000 -t public
</code>
