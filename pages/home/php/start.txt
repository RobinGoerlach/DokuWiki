==== Manual Installation ====

Manual installation and configuration of Database, Web Server, PHP and tools, depending on your OS, but max freedom

=== PHP on macOS ===

PHP is already installed with an Apache 2.x Webserver. The default Document Root Directory is **"/Library/WebServer/Documents"**

=== PHP on Linux ===
**Install PHP on CentOS**
<code bash>
sudo yum install epel-release -y
sudo yum install https://rpms.remirepo.net/enterprise/remi-release-9.rpm -y 
sudo dnf module reset php -y
sudo dnf module enable php:remi-8.2 -y
sudo dnf install php php-cli php-mysqlnd php-xml php-mbstring -y
php -v
sudo systemctl restart httpd

echo "<?php phpinfo(); ?>" | sudo tee /var/www/html/info.php
</code>

**Install PHP on Debian/Ubuntu**
<code bash>
sudo apt update
sudo apt install php libapache2-mod-php php-mysql -y

php -v
echo "<?php phpinfo(); ?>" | sudo tee /var/www/html/info.php
</code>

==== PHP on Windows ====

  * [[http://laragon.org|Laragon]] Download Laragon full bringt Cmder, MySQL, HeidiSQL und Apache gleich mit 

==== All in One Solution ====
Contains a preconfigured Web Server, PHP, Databases and some tools
  *  [[https://apachefriends.org/|XAMPP]]/MAMP/WAMP are all in one solution products, bundling preconfigured web server (Apache), PHP, database (MySQL/MariaDB) and useful tools (phpmyadmin). Alternatively use Docker or Virtual Machines, or install Apache, MySQL, PHP and phpmyadmin one by one.
    * The installation of [[https://apachefriends.org/|XAMPP]] & Co is simple but does not support instilling multiple PHP versions at the same time out of the box. Not multiple MySQL Version, Difficult to maintain multiple projects
    * Its not suited for production due to security. 
    * "Works on my machine" with differing configuration between local setup and production. Differences could bin minor if you know what you are doing, or could be major like different versions in PHP or MySQL. Different in installed packages what end in "it works on my local machine but not in production. Using [[https://apachefriends.org/|XAMPP]] & Co is absolutely okay for getting things running fast or hobby projects and playing around with PHP. 

Try [[http://localhost/dashboard/|XAMPP Dashboard]] to see if installation is working. Delete the content of htdocs or create a directory below htdocs and create a index.php file there.

==== Virtual Machines or Docker Solution ====

  * 





===== Run a PHP Script =====

<code bash>
php index.php
php -S localhost:8000 
php -S localhost:8000 -t public
</code>
