**[[home:|Start]]** -> **[[home:php:|PHP]]** -> **PHP Object Oriented Programming**

====== PHP OOP ======

In procedural programming an application or a program is divided into a set of functions that operate on some sort of data that are stored in variables, so you basically have some sort of global state or variables and a bunch of functions that work with those variables. It could have functions calling other functions and so on.

In Object-Oriented Programming however you're basically combining or bundling related functions and variable into something called a class from which you create objects. You could access variable and call functions of the object if they if they are publicly available. We refer to the variables of the object or the class as properties and the functions as methods. A Class is a blueprint of an object and an object is something that you create or build from that blueprint. You could have many objects of the same class but each of those objects can be different in it's data. Objects are instances of the classes, the main advantage of object oriented programming is the ability to structure your code in a better way that is easier to maintain, test, extend, debug and so on. Through this does not mean that procedural programming is useless, there are some use cases for procedural programming, it might be a good pick for a small project that not require many features or much maintenance and you're the only one working on it. Not everything has to be object oriented but as your code grows and your project requirements increase you will find yourself in a trap where modifying extending and maintaining that code becomes difficult., especially when you're working in teams this is where object-oriented programming can help you, but do know that object-oriented programming does not mean your code will automatically be easier to maintain. Essentially it is up to you as a developer to ensure that you write your code in a way that is maintainable extendable readable and reusable. Object-oriented programming makes things easier for you to write such code. Also object-oriented programming is on demand meaning that you won't find many companies looking for programmers with experience in just procedural programming, most of them require object-oriented programming skills.

Thus object-oriented programming mean MVC? No and this is th misconception that I see a lot in object-oriented  programming. Object-oriented programming does not automatically imply MVC, object-oriented programming is a paradigm while MCV is an architecture pattern of Model-View-Controller which uses the object-oriented programming principles. Simply object-oriented programming does not imply MVC.

OOP is a fundamental programming paradigm that is based on the concept of "objects". Your code is structured to model real-world entities and their interactions within computer programs. Classes are created as "blueprints" for an object. Object-oriented programming has four main principles and these are encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance and polymorphism. 

**Core Concepts of OOP**
  * **Classes**: Blueprint or template to create and use an object
  * **Objects**: Self containing unit that encapsulates properties and methods
  * **Inheritance**: Allows one class to inherit properties/methods from another class
  * **Encapsulation**: Bundling the data and methods into a single unit
  * **Polymorphism**: Allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass

**Benefits of OOP**
  * **Modularity**: makes managing complex systems easier.
  * **Reusability**: code recycling in multiple projects, or reuse a single class in multiple objects in a single project.
  * **Scalability**: extend existing classes or functionality without disrupting existing code
  * **Abstraction**: allows to abstract complex systems by modelling them with simplified objects

===== Classes & Objects =====

A class is like a blueprint and an object is something that you build from that blueprint or in other words an instance of that class. An object is an PHP data type with multiple variable (called properties) and fitting functions (called methods) to handle the data in such properties (variables). Check the [[https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.intro.php|PHP Language Reference on Types]]

PHP has a generic class implementation called std class that could use to create generic objects or you could cast your variables that are of another data types into objects. In addition to being able to create objects using generic std class you can also create your own custom classes. The definition of a class must begin with a class keyword followed by the class name which should begin either with a letter or an underscore followed by letters, numbers or underscores. Then we add curly braces to enclose the class definition. Note that you could follow different standards and conventions when it comes to naming your variables or classes or overall your code structure. The recommended way is to have a single class per file and nothing else in that file, with the file named after the class name, or the class name is named like the file containing the class code. You don't have to name your classes after your file but that is the recommended and widely used convention. You could also have more than one class definitions in a file which would work perfectly fine but again it is not the recommended way.

**controllers/User.php**
<code php>
<?php
class User {
  // Properties
  public $name; // = 'John Doe';
  public $email; // = 'john@gmail.com';
  
  // Methods
  public function login() {
    // ...
  }
}
</code>
Naming convention is to start classes with an uppercase letter. Public properties like $name can be accessed from out side the class, this is a no no use getter and setter methods (functions belonging to a class).

To create an object out of that class, what widely happens in a different file, like index.php. To create a variable pointing to the class followed by parenthesis, we have to use the new keyword followed by the class name followed by parentheses. The parentheses is not always required, depending on your constructor but it's always a good idea to stay consistent and just parentheses regardless.

**index.php**
<code php>
<?php
require_once '../controllers/User.php';

// Instantiate class as a new object
$user1 = new User();

// Set property values
$user1->name = 'John Doe';
$user1->email = 'john@gmail.com';
var_dump($user1);

// Run a method
$user1->login();
</code>
The class file has to be explicitly included or required in the file using the class, to be able to create the object.

===== Access Modifiers, Getters and Setters =====

Properties (inside class variables) should not be accessed directly. Therefore the **visibility** (or access modifier) should not be public as in the example above. Sometimes not all methods (inside class functions) should be  accessible from outside the class. To define the visibility of the property to either
  * **public**: The property or method can be accessed from anywhere inside or outside of the class. This allows interaction objects outside of the class. This is the default if no modifier is given. 
  * **protected**: The property or method can be accessed from within the class OR any class that inherits from it
  * **private**: The property or method can only be accessed from within the class
and these are also **called access modifiers** and they should be added to both properties and methods so we start with the access modifier followed by the variable name. 

Accessing properties should happen with methods, one for stetting a value (so called setter method) and on for property value reading (so called getter method). One big advantage of setters is you could check if the value to be set is within legal values of your application or getters could return a default value if non set up to now. You also could check user access rights, as is it allowed for this user to change or read the value. 

To assign this values to the properties or to access the properties inside the object or class within the class itself we need to use a **variable called $this**. The **$this variable refers to the calling object** or in other words it refers to to the instance from which the method was called from. Due to properties not being accessible from outside the class we need methods to access the values assigned to properties. This methods are called **getters to retrieve the value** assigned to an property and **setters to assign a new value** to an property. 

Only the class the property belonging to should be allowed to explicity change the values of properties. Explicitly changeing from outside the class should anything other than the class should be done through methods of the class like getters and setters or transcation methods.

**controllers/User.php**
<code php>
<?php
class User {
  // Properties
  private $name;
  private $email;
  private $status = 'active';
  
  // Getter and Setter
  public function getName() {
    return $this->name;
  }
   public function setName($chicken) {
    $this->status = $chicken;
  }
    
  public function getEmail() {
    return $this->email;
  }
   public function setEmail($email) {
    $this->status = $email;
  }
    
  public function getStatus() {
    return $this->status;
  }
   public function setStatus($status) {
    $this->status = $status;
  }
    
  // Methods
  public function login() {
    // ...
  }
}
</code>
The values of this properties will be set to null if you don't assign them the value, so null will be the default for them. There is one exception to this when using type hinting. 

Accessing public properties of methods everyone interacting with the object even outside of the class we have to do is use **object operator** which is -> followed by the method or property to be accessed. Is the method or property is not accessible due to access modifier you'll get an Uncaught Error: Cannot access private property.  
<code php>
<?php
$user2 = new User('Jane Doe', 'jane@gmail.com');
$user2->setSatus('inactive');
echo $user2->getName() . ' is ' . $user2->getSatus();
</code>
PHP 7.4 introduced typed properties, which means that you could set the type of the property in the definition. Type hinting is recommended but not required, it is up to you if you want to use it or not. **Recommendation is type hinting and strict type usage**. Note PHP is not able to determine whether a property that has a type was actually set or you simply forgot to set a value, that's why accessing a object without initialisation will lead to a Uncaugth Error: ... must not be accessed before initialisation. This is why the new state was introduced called uninitialized when type is defined and value is not assigned to a property it is in uninitialized state. If not using strict type, uninitialized properties will have the value NULL. To solve the issue of accessing properties before initialization is to actually assign some kind of value as default value either directly at the definition or in something called constructor or a so called setter. Something to note is that you're only able to assign constant values as the default values you cannot have complex expressions here like function calls and so on. If you need to the nullable property you would add the question mark in front of the type definition and you would set the default value to NULL, in that case it would work, but this kind of assignment doesn't really make sense.

Setting values can alternatively be defined within something called constructor. A method to be called when creating an object out of the class with the new keyword.

==== Magic Getters and Setters ====

<code php>
<?php
__get
__set
</code>
===== Constructors =====

Due to have properties not publicly available with the private access modifier, which could cause some unnecessary bugs where properties are changed from outside the Class we need different ways to access the properties. The constructor is a method to be called when creating an object out of the class with the new keyword. The constructor can be used to initialize class properties. The constructor  method is a special function, also known as a magic function that will be called whenever a new instance of the class is created is named **construct() with double underscore at the beginning**. The constructor has no arguments by default but it accepts arguments, so you could add values to it to initialize the object with it to assign these values to the properties. 
<code php>
<?php
class User {
  // Properties
  private $name;
  private$email;

  
  //Constructors 
  public function __construct() {
    echo 'User Constructor ran ... <br />'; 
    // ...
  }

  public function __construct($name, $email) { // Polymorphism
    echo 'User Constructor ran ... <br />'; 
    $this->name = $name;
    $this->email = $email;
  }
  
  // Methods
  public function login() {
    // ...
  }
}
</code>
If the constructor needs to get arguments and you call it without, you'll get an Uncaught ArgumentCountError. The construct method does accept the three dot variadic parameter, allowing you to pass any number of arguments when creating an object, but you should consider associative array then.
<code php>
<?php
// Instantiate class as a new object
$user1 = new User('jane Doe', 'jane@gmail.com');
$user1->login();
</code>


===== Method chaining ===== 

Lets assume we need multiple methods, of our object changing property values, that we have to call before getting the result we need. Instead calling one method after they other, or one by one you can chain methods by returning the current object from those methods so instead of returning nothing we could return 
the $this variable which refers to the calling object which is an instance of the class. So we can use the class name as return type in method declaration, there is another way to specify this by using the self keyword. 
<code php>
<?php
declare(strict_types=1);
class Transaction {
  private float $amount;
  private string $description;
  
  public function __construct(float $amount, string $description) {
    $this->amount = $amount;
    $this->description = $description;
  }
  
  public function addTax(float $rate): self {
    $this->amount += $this->amount * $rate /100;
    return $this;
  }
  
  public function applyDiscount(float $rate): self {
    $this->amount -= $this->amount * $rate /100;
    return $this;
  }
  
  public function getAmount(): float {
     return $this->amount;
  }
  
  public function setAmount(float $amount): float {
     $this->amount = $amount;
  }  
}
</code>
Instead of calling each method one by one, we can chain them. 
<code php>
<?php
declare(strict_types=1);
require_once '../Transaction.php';

$transaction = new Transaction(100, 'Initial Debit');
// $transaction->applyDiscount(10);
// $transaction->addTax(19);
$transaction->applyDiscount(10)->addTax(19);

echo 'Transaction Payload: ' . $transaction->getAmount();
</code>
Here everything still works but now we are able to do something like this where methods are changed as shown above. We could even change this to do something like the following. Put the new command in parenthesis and remove all class calls, this will still work. For better readability we could add a line break before each arrow, if we have many arrow calls, so we would have the methods on separate lines and this would still work. 
<code php>
<?php
declare(strict_types=1);
require_once '../Transaction.php';

$transaction = (new Transaction(100, 'Initial Debit'))
   ->applyDiscount(10)
   ->addTax(19);

echo 'Transaction Payload: ' . $transaction->getAmount();
</code>
Even better we can set $transaction to $amount if we don't care to have the reference to that object renamed. 
<code php>
<?php
declare(strict_types=1);
require_once '../Transaction.php';

$amount = (new Transaction(100, 'Initial Debit'))
   ->applyDiscount(10)
   ->addTax(19)
   ->getAmount();

echo 'Transaction Payload: ' . $amount;
</code>
As you can see chaining methods creates this more readable way of building your objects and shorter code. Chaining methods will not always make sense, chaining methods would not make sense if we had to return some type of value not the current instance. Also try not to force yourself creating chained method structures in all of your classes. It only makes sense for certain classes where you want to build up the object  before getting the final value.

===== Variables as Class name ===== 

Another way you could create objects is by using variables instead of class name. Everything works the same as with hard coded class names.
<code php>
<?php
declare(strict_types=1);
require_once '../Transaction.php';
$class = 'transaction';

$amount = (new $class(100, 'Initial Debit'))
   ->applyDiscount(10)
   ->addTax(19)
   ->getAmount();

echo 'Transaction Payload: ' . $amount;
</code>
Dynamic class names are used when the class can or should change at runtime, as different database classes (MySQL, Postgres, SQLite). 

===== Destructors ===== 

The destructor message is the opposite of the constructor, it's also a magic message and therefore it starts with **two underscores** before the keyword **destruct**. The destruct method is called whenever there is no more reference available to the object or when the object is destroyed. The destructor can be used to perform some sort of cleanup or release locks or close open resources or database connections and so on. You do not need to define destructors a lot only when you really need to and have the actual use case for it. It is recommended that if you have a resource or a database connection open to close it as soon as you're done working with them and as soon as you no longer need them. Just in case you have a long run in script and you don't close the connection as soon as you're done using it it's going to keep that connection open until the script finishes running so unless you have a good use case for destructors. Try to stay away from them and close your connection as soon as you're done using them. 

**Transaction.php**
<code php>
<?php
   public function __destruct() {
     echo 'Destruct Transaction' . $this->description . '<br />';
   }
}   
</code>

The destructor will show up each time the object is removed from the memory, basically it's destroyed 
<code php>
<?php
declare(strict_types=1);
$amount = (new Transaction(100, 'Initial Debit'))
  ->applyDiscount(10)
  ->addTax(8)
  ->getAmount();

echo $amount;
</code>
The Destruct Transaction message will be displayed before the amount value. This means the destruct method will be called first, this means there is no reference available to this transaction aside from here and therefore it's calling the destruct and it's printing destruct transaction and then we're printing the amount. 
<code php>
<?php
declare(strict_types=1);
$transaction = (new Transaction(100, 'Initial Debit'))
  ->applyDiscount(10)
  ->addTax(8);

echo $transaction->getAmount();
</code>
This code would first show the amount value and afterwards the Destruct Transaction message, because we still have the reference available to the transaction object in the echo statement to print the amount first and then call the destruct method.

<code php>
<?php
declare(strict_types=1);
$transaction = (new Transaction(100, 'Initial Debit'))
  ->applyDiscount(10)
  ->addTax(8);
$amount = $transaction->getAmount();
echo $amount;
</code>
In this case the reference is still available until the end of the script. When the script ends that's when the destructor is called and that is why it first prints the amount and then it calls the destruct.

<code php>
<?php
$transaction = (new Transaction(100, 'Initial Debit'))
  ->applyDiscount(10)
  ->addTax(8);
$amount = $transaction->getAmount();

unset($transaction); // $transaction=NULL; 
echo $amount;
</code>
In this code the Object is destroyed before the scripts ends, so the Destroy Transaction message will show up before the amount value is displayed. 

A couple of   things to know about destructors if you use exit statement to terminate your script you will still call the destructor. If you put an exit statement in the destruct method, whenever this specific destruct method runs no other destruct methods on other classes, which can cause some issues if you're performing some actions and relying on those methods to run that are within the destructors of other classes.

===== PHP std class ===== 

The std class can be used to create generic objects and also some functions return instances of std class and the keys of the array or the keys for the json, in the following code, will become the properties of the class and the values will become the values of those properties. so now you're able to use those properties using the object operator (->).
<code php>
<?php
$str = {"a":1,"b":2,"c":3};
$arr = json_decode($str, true); // convert to associated array
$obj = json_decode($str);  // convert to an object as an instance of std class 

var_dump($obj->a);
</code>
We can create custom objects by using the std class itself and then set the properties the way you would set a public property on your own custom class, using the object operator, so you would do objects property a equals something. 
<code php>
<?php
$obj = new \stdClass();
$obj->a = 'Hello';
$obj->b = 'World';
</code>

**Type casting** from or to stdClass, works pretty similar as type casting works. 
<code php>
<?php
$arr = [1, 2, 3];
$obj = (object) $array;  // convert array to object with keys as properties 
var_dump($obj->{0}); // = 1
</code>
The numerically indexed array is casted to an object with properties which is 0, 1 and 2. Remember to surround the properties with curly brackets.

Converting Scalar into objects (Integer, Float, Strings, Boolean)
<code php>
<?php
$obj = (object) 1;  // convert integer to object
var_dump($obj->scalar); // = 1
</code>
<code php>
<?php
$obj = (object) false;  // convert bool to object
var_dump($obj->scalar); // = 0
</code>
Null is casted into an empty object without any properties.

===== Constructor Property Promotion =====
[[https://wiki.php.net/rfc/constructor_promotion|Constructor Property promotion]] is a feature that was edit in PHP 8.0, it allows you to get ride of the boilerplate code where you define properties and then assignee them to the arguments that are passed in your constructor. Basically it lets you combine class properties constructor and assignment into one shorter syntax. The following code is perfectly fine.
<code php>
<?php
declare(strict_types = 1);
class Transaction {
  private float  $amount;
  private string $description;
  
  public function __construct(
    private float  $amount,
    private string $description
  ) {
    $this->amount      = $amount;
    $this->description = $description;
  }
}
</code>
But now there is an shorthand version of this. Basically of this now you are able to add a visibility or access modifier directly in your constructor. PHP will interpreted both in the constructor the property and the constructor argument and it will assigned the value that is passed to the constructor to that property behind the scenes to basic it still does the definition and the property reassignment for you. You don't have to do that. 
<code php>
<?php
declare(strict_types = 1);
class Transaction {
  public function __construct(
    float  $amount,
    string $description
  ) {
  }
}
</code>
This code will do the same, in PHP 8.0, as the code before. So as you see Constructor Property Promotion feature offers a shorthand version with much cleaner syntax and less boilerplate code. While PHP behind the scenes does the same as before.

There are a few things you need to be aware of. First thing you can **type hint any type except callable**, that's because can not type hint properties with callable type, PHP dose not allow that. As argument you can use callable as type hint without access modifier, because then you are not allowed to use it with an access modifier. 

You are allowed to use promoted properties with class properties. So you don' have to promote all the properties. 
<code php>
<?php
declare(strict_types = 1);
class Transaction {
  privat float $amount;
  
  public function __construct(
    float  $amount,
    string $description
  ) {
    $this->amount = $amount;
  }
}
</code>
Another thing you need to be aware of you **can not have duplicates** meaning you can not have **a property and promotes property** at the same time with the same name. You don't have to type hint properties you can also promote untyped properties. 

Next thing you should know is you could assign default value to promoted properties, but have to **follow the same rules** you can only have a simple expression or constant values as default, we can not use function calls or complex expressions. 
<code php>
<?php
declare(strict_types = 1);
class Transaction {
  privat float $amount = 100.50;
  
  public function __construct(
    float  $amount,
    private string $description = 'Hello'
  ) {
  }
}
</code>
If you are assigning a default of **NULL** you will need to make that **property nullable typed**  
<code php>
<?php
declare(strict_types = 1);
class Transaction {
  privat float $amount = 100.50;
  
  public function __construct(
    float  $amount,
    private ?string $description = null // ? makes it nullable
  ) {
  }
}
</code>
**Accessing promoted properties** is by using the $this variable. Another way is to access the **promoted property simply without $this**. 
<code php>
<?php
declare(strict_types = 1);
class Transaction {
  public function __construct(
    float  $amount,
    private string $description
  ) {
    echo amount;
  }
}
</code>
===== Nullsafe operator =====

The Nullsafe operator allows to chain methods even if they return null. The nullsafe operator is a question mark ?-> used after the method name, which could return null, in the chain and before the object operator. Without the Nullsafe operator we need to nest a lot of null checks as you see in the following code, otherwise in case of property or method access returning null, we would get a Warning Attempt to read property ... on null.
<code php>
<?php
require_once '../PaymentProfile.php';
require_once '../Customer.php';
require_once '../Transaction.php';
$transaction = new Transaction(5, 'Test');
$profileId = null;
if ($customer = $transaction->getCustomer()) {
  if ($paymentProfile = $customer->getPaymentProfile()) {
    $profileId = $paymentProfile->id;
  }
}
echo $profileId ;
</code>
How does the nullsafe operator work? The nullsafe operator basically solves this problem be short circuiting the property or method access and will return null immediately as soon as it is null without accounting the rest of the expression. In the following code, if customer is null the rest of the code in this line would be discarded. 
<code php>
<?php
require_once '../PaymentProfile.php';
require_once '../Customer.php';
require_once '../Transaction.php';
$transaction = new Transaction(5, 'Test');
echo $transaction->customer?->paymentProfile?->id;
</code>
You can chain the nullsafe operator but this isn't very helpful in most cases. It is helpful working with the Null coalescing operator. There are a few things to know and be aware of when working with nullsafe operator, first of all it's read-only, meaning you can not write or assign a value to it, so the following code will not work.
<code php>
<?php
$transaction->customer?->paymentProfile?->id = 42;
</code>
Also be careful not to pass important function calls, that needs to be executed even when null are present in the chain, be aware of short circuiting important function being not executed. Check [[https://wiki.php.net/rfc/nullsafe_operator|PHP RFC: Nullsafe operator]] 


The Null coalescing operator ?? will return an alternative value if something fails on an object being null.
<code php>
<?php
require_once '../PaymentProfile.php';
require_once '../Customer.php';
require_once '../Transaction.php';
$transaction = new Transaction(5, 'Test');
echo $transaction->getCustomer()?->getPaymentProfile()?->id ?? 'foo';
</code>
===== Namespaces =====
When you define a function a constant or a class without a namespace definition by default they will be put in a global space. In this example here transaction class has no namespace definition may cause name collision where you might have multiple classes that have the same name. PHP will not know which one to instantiate because two classes with the same name. When requiring two classes with the same name and that are not namespaced meaning that they're in a global space this will cause an **Fatal Error Cannot declare class ..., because the name is already in use**. <code php>
<?php
declare(strict_types = 1);
require_once '../PaymentGateway/Stripe/Transaction.php';
require_once '../PaymentGateway/Paddle/Transaction.php';
var_dump(new Transaction()); // which Transaction class to be use?
</code>
Before namespaces where introduced often this was solved by prefixing the class name with the vendor name or the namespace name within the class. In addition to the name collision fixes it also lets you better structure and organize your classes and code same thing would happen with the constants, interfaces, traits or functions. Think of namespaces as virtual directory structures for your classes. We can define namespaces using the namespace keyword on top of the file before any code and after declare(strict_types = 1); statement. 
<code php>
<?php
declare(strict_types = 1);
namespace core;
</code>
You could name the namespace what ever you want as an example you could take your name, a package name or whatever.
Defining a name space in a script will define this for all classes, constants, interfaces, functions and traits after this point in the PHP script, to avoid conflicts in naming with other PHP files. If you require a class with namespace the location of the file will not change, so the require statement is the same but calling the class will change, otherwise PHP will throw an Uncaught Error: Class not found, because PHP is looking for the class by default in global space. There are two ways to fix this issue, one is we need to **add qualifying class name including the namespace** in here so we would do something like Stripe\Transaction.php or Paddle\Transaction.php. Another way is to import the class from the namespace by using the **use** keyword as shown in the second following example.
Instead of single namespace you could have sub namespaces which makes more sense and you can make your namespaces follow the directory structure this could lead to a code as follows.
<code php>
<?php
declare(strict_types = 1);
require_once '../PaymentGateway/Stripe/Transaction.php';
require_once '../PaymentGateway/Paddle/Transaction.php';

var_dump(new PaymentGateway\Stripe\Transaction()); 
</code>
So everything is working, just something to note here the namespaces match the folder structure this is why you can think of namespaces as virtual directory structure, this is not a requirement, you can put the file anywhere you want and still namespace it anyway you want but it is recommended and also a standard to match namespace with the folder structure.

Importing the class namespace by using the **use** keyword followed by the namespace and class name.
<code php>
<?php
declare(strict_types = 1);
require_once '../PaymentGateway/Stripe/Transaction.php';
require_once '../PaymentGateway/Paddle/Transaction.php';

use PaymentGateway\Stripe\Transaction;
var_dump(new Transaction()); 
</code>
**PaymentGateway/Stripe/Transaction.php**
<code php>
<?php
declare(strict_types = 1);
namespace PaymentGateway\Stripe;

class Transaction
{

}
</code>
**PaymentGateway/Paddle/Transaction.php**
<code php>
<?php
declare(strict_types = 1);
namespace PaymentGateway\Paddle;

class Transaction
{

}
</code>
In addition in name spacing and importing classes you can name space constants and functions and import them as well, this is not widely used and shouldn't be used but you could name space your custom functions and constants and then import them using use and then function and specify the function name after your namespace or you could do the same thing for constants using use const. 

Instantiating classes that are within the same namespaces, there you don't need to use the namespace you can use only the class name, because PHP will try to load classes from the current namespace if you are in a name spaced file.

If you were to access PHP's build-in classes you will need to add a backslash to tell PHP to load it from the global space or you will need to import them. 
<code php>
<?php
declare(strict_types = 1);
namespace PaymentGateway\Paddle;
use DateTime;

class Transaction
{
  public function __construct()
  {
    var_dump(new DateTime());
  }
}
</code>
If you need a **class from another namespace** e.g. Notification\Email PHP would prepend this as a sub name space from the current name space, so it try's to locate the email class under PaymentGateway\Paddle\Notification\Email. To prevent this we, need to use a **full qualified namespace name** and the difference between the qualified and full qualified name is that **full qualified name is prefixed by backslash**, which indicates that this is the full namespace to that class. When you use that qualified name instead of the full qualified name, then what PHP will do this it will try to see if there is an import statement, that resolves to notification namespace and if it does then this would work otherwise it will prepend the namespace as a sub namespace. This will lead to an Uncaught Error Class not found. There are two ways we could fix this one is we could prepend it with the backslash to make it full qualified name in the new statement or we could simply import with use it and then it would work
<code php>
<?php
declare(strict_types = 1);
namespace PaymentGateway\Paddle;

class Transaction
{
  public function __construct()
  {
    var_dump(new \Notification\Email());
  }
}
</code>
The build-in functions will be resolved from the global space, this is because PHP will locate the in global space, but not with classes PHP will try to locate them in the local name space and if it doesn't exist it will throw an error unless you had the use statement where you imported that class. If a function does not exist in the local namespace then it falls back to the global namespace.
<code php>
<?php
declare(strict_types = 1);
namespace PaymentGateway\Paddle;

class Transaction
{
  public function __construct()
  {
    var_dump(explode((',', 'hello,world'));
  }
}

function explode($seperator, $arg)
{
  return 'foo';
}
</code>
This code will return the foo string, without the own explode function we would call the build-in explode function from the global namespace. Sometimes this can be intended but sometimes can cause unexpected bugs so you should want to prefix build-in functions with backslash to ensure that you're using PHP's build-in function from the global space instead of the locally defined function in that namespace. This is why you see some developers use backslash when using PHP's build-in functions in namespace classes. Another reason why they would prefix PHP's build-in functions with backslash is the possible speed improvement because you're telling PHP exactly where to load that function from and PHP does not have to resolve it which could have positive impact on performance but very negligible.

Using multiple classes with the same name can still be a problem, as in the following code example
<code php>
<?php
declare(strict_types = 1);
require_once '../PaymentGateway/Stripe/Transaction.php';
require_once '../PaymentGateway/Paddle/Transaction.php'; 

use PaymentGateway\Stripe\Transaction;
use PaymentGateway\Paddle\Transaction as PaddleTransaction;  // or name already in use error

$stripeTransaction = new Transaction();
$paddleTransaction = new PaddleTransaction(); // again which is which
var_dump($stripeTransaction, $paddleTransaction); 
</code>
Name spacing is not helping in this style of code, you could use full qualified naming in the new statement and skip the use statements or by aliasing on of the classes. You're able to do that in PHP so in here we can us **as keyword to define an alias** like PaddleTransaction.

Aliasing can also be used to deal with long class names, another use case for aliasing would be that if we were inside the PaymentGateway\paddle\Transaction class and you are using some kind of package or library that also has the transaction class in there and you want to use that transaction class or extend from in your transaction class then you would need to do something like use vendor name transaction and this would not work because the current class name is transaction and you're trying to import another class with the same name, aliasing would work as well, give it a nickname, you could name it want you want but usually the name of the package or the author of the library. 
<code php>
<?php
declare(strict_types = 1);
namespace PaymentGateway\Paddle;
require_once './PayPal/Transaction.php';
use PayPal\Transaction as VendorTransaction;  // without alias already in use error

class Transaction
{
  public function __construct()
  {
  }
}
</code>
If your importing multiple classes from the same namespace you could actually group them together by combining class names in curly braces in a single use statement. 
<code php>
<?php
declare(strict_types = 1);
require_once '../PaymentGateway/Paddle/Transaction.php'; 
require_once '../PaymentGateway/Paddle/CustomerProfile.php'; 
use PaymentGateway\Paddle\{Transaction,CustomerProfile}; // grouped instead of two use statements

$paddleTransaction = new Transaction(); 
$paddleCustomerProfile = new CustomerProfile();
var_dump($paddleTransaction, $paddleCustomerProfile); 
</code>
Another way you could do this instead of grouping them into a single line you could simply import the namespace itself. Therefore you import the qualified namespace without a class name and instantiate the class with the last part of the namespace if you have sub name spaces.
<code php>
<?php
declare(strict_types = 1);
require_once '../PaymentGateway/Paddle/Transaction.php'; 
require_once '../PaymentGateway/Paddle/CustomerProfile.php'; 
use PaymentGateway\Paddle; // importing name space

$paddleTransaction = new Paddle\Transaction(); 
$paddleCustomerProfile = new Paddle\CustomerProfile();
var_dump($paddleTransaction, $paddleCustomerProfile); 
</code>
This will work as well. In some cases this is the preferred way where you're importing a lot of classes from the same namespaces instead of listing all of them with its own use statement or a long list of combined class names. So you can import the namespace and prefix your classes with that namespace. Recommendation is import everything in the use statements because that way you will see what are all the classes that this specific class or file depends on when you open a class file.

Another thing to note about the aliasing is that it could actually alias the entire namespace as well.
<code php>
<?php
declare(strict_types = 1);
require_once '../PaymentGateway/Paddle/Transaction.php'; 
require_once '../PaymentGateway/Paddle/CustomerProfile.php'; 
use PaymentGateway\Paddle as PA; // importing name space with alias

$paddleTransaction = new PA\Transaction(); 
$paddleCustomerProfile = new PA\CustomerProfile();
var_dump($paddleTransaction, $paddleCustomerProfile); 
</code>
Something you need to know that importing rules are profile based, what that means is that if we include another file later in the script the included file will not inherit the classes that were imported in the parent file so if you want to use these classes in the included file you would need them there as well.

What still needs to be discussed is using multiple name spaces in the same file, but this us nor widely used.

===== Coding standard =====

PHP is very forgiving when it comes to code layout or structure. You can put spaces, tabs or new line into your code, which makes code difficult to read for humans but it will still work fine, just through you  probably would not do that even if you didn't follow any conventions or standards because it would make it harder for you to maintain it so why would you follow any conventions or standards well let's say you work in a team or that you work on an open source project you preferer to structure and write it based on your own style while other developers like to follow their own style and taste like curly braces in a new line or not or camel case vs snake case and so on this will lead to a lot of inconsistencies which makes code harder to read and maintain. Take open source libraries or frameworks as an example an open source project can have hundreds of developers contributing to them if everyone followed their own conventions the code base would be a big pile of inconsistent spaghetti. This is why we have **[[https://php-fig.org/|PSR]]** which stands for **PHP Standard Recommendation** is maintained by PHP framework interoperability group or short **[[https://php-fig.org|php-fig]]**. This group was formed by several PHP framework founders and developers and since then a lot more members has joined the group. 

[[https://php-fig.org/psr|PSR standard table]] with the currently accepted standards sorted by PSR Standard number
  * **[[https://php-fig.org/psr/psr-1|PSR-1 Basic Coding Standard]]** for example files must only use <?php or <?= or first letter in class name should be capitalized, constants must be declared in all upper case and underscore as separators, methods should be camelCase 
  * **[[https://php-fig.org/psr/psr-4|PSR-4 Autoloading]]** Notice [[https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.autoload.php|Autoloading Classes]] should not throw exceptions or return a value 
  * **[[https://php-fig.org/psr/psr-12|PSR-12 Extended Coding Style]]** replaces [[https://php-fig.org/psr/psr-2|PSR-2 (Coding Style Guide)]] and adds more standards to it and it also requires you to follow [[https://php-fig.org/psr/psr-1|PSR-1]].
It's not an requirement to follow these standards but it's just a good habit that lets you write consistent code. Many PHP IDE's like [[https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/|PHPStorm]] have plugins supporting coding styles like Laravel or Joomla Guide and there you could press CTRL-L and code will be formatted in PSR-12 formatting or what ever you have selected. You can set soft limits of the lines and so on. If you're not using [[https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/|PHPStorm]] simply google PHP code sniffer or PSR plugin for your code editor  

See also [[https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/README.md|psr@github]] and remember by following PSR standards there can be also framework specific conventions and standards. The key thing here is the consistency. 

===== Autoloader =====

As you can imagine requiring and including files can get very ugly, very fast the more classes you have the more require statements you would need. Autoloading solves this problem PHP has a function called **spl_autoload_register()** and it accepts a few arguments and the first one is that we care about which is a call-back function which is our custom auto loading function and this function receives the fully qualified class name as the argument

If a class is already loaded with require PHP will skip classes that are already loaded and therefor it doesn't need to run our autoloader so what autoloading does is that it automatically loads your classes, interfaces and trails that are not already included or in other words are undefined (Uncaught Error: Class not found). So what's happening is that when we try to use or access a class PHP will check if that class exists, if it does not exist before throwing any errors it looks for any registered autoloader functions and runs them one by one when you register auto loaders they go into queue and are executed one by one whenever class is not found we can see this in action.
==== Simple Autoloader ====

When PHP encounters a class or interface that has not yet been defined, it triggers the autoload mechanism. Functions registered with spl_autoload_register() are then called in sequence. Each of these functions receives the missing class name as an argument, and it is their responsibility to locate and load the corresponding file (for example by including it). Once the file is loaded and the class is defined, PHP continues execution as if the class had been available from the start. The goal is to **simplify require basePath('...');**, all class files needed do not have to be loaded individually by require.

**index.php**
<code php>
<?php
require '../helpers.php';

spl_autoload_register(function($class) {
   $path = basePath('core/' . $class . 'php';
   if (file_exists($path)) {
     require $path;
   }
});

//Initiate the router
$router = new Router();
</code>
You could, if needed, add multiple autoloader functions, these will run one by one. The first registered function will run first and the next registered function runs afterwards. 
<code php>
<?php
spl_autoload_register(function($class) {
   echo Autoloader 1;
});
spl_autoload_register(function($class) {
   echo Autoloader 2;
});
// ...
</code>
You can pass the third argument as true to prepend autoloader in the queue instead of appending it to the end, so we could simply use a named argument and the **third argument is the prepend argument**
<code php>
<?php
spl_autoload_register(function($class) {
   echo Autoloader 1;
});
spl_autoload_register(function($class) {
   echo Autoloader 2;
}, prepend: true);
// ...
</code>
Now second autoloader runs first.


So what has to be done by a self customized autoloader to require classes?
  * transfer name space into file pass
  * deal with uppercase and lowercase differences in namespace and file path
  * handle proper pathing ../ or magic DIR or add a path prefix like '../core/'
<code php>
<?php
require '../helpers.php';

spl_autoload_register(function($class) {
   $path = __DIR__ . '/../' . lcfirst(str_replace('\\', '/',  $class)) . 'php';
   if (file_exists($path)) {
     require $path;
   } else 
     // %
   }
});

//Initiate the router
$router = new Router();
</code>
Check the [[https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/|PSR-4: Autoloader]] [[https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/examples/|Example Implementations]]

==== Vendor Autoloader ====

The [[https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/|PSR-4: Vendor Autoloader]] is working as a package installed with the **[[home:php:pkg:composer:|Composer]]** package manager for php, like npm in Node.js, with a composer.json file as application manifest. The composer can also specify an PSR-4 autoloader. The autoloader knows how to autoload classes from vendor directory but it does not know how to load our on classes from the app or framework directory. We can fix this by simply telling composer how to autoload our own classes in the composer.json file and add an option to autoload. In the autoload/psr-4 section we map out namespace to the location of that namespace as you see with App and Framework, after editing composer.json composers autoload files need to be regenerated (check files in vendor/composer/autoload*php) especially vendor/composer/autoload_psr4.php that contains the namespaces for our dependencies but it does not contain our own namespaces without regeneration. 
<code json>
{
   "name" : "robingoerlach/workopia-php",
   "description": "Job Portal",
   "authors": [ 
      {
        "name": "Robin Goerlach",
        "email": "support@sasd.de"
      }
    ],
    "require": {
        "ramsey/uuid": "^4.1"
    }
    "autoload": {
       "psr-4": {
          "App\\": "app/",
          "Framework\\": "core/"
     }  
}
</code>
**composer.json**

  * **name**: Github Repo name
  * **psr-4**: needs namespaces used in the project

<code bash>
#composer install
composer dump-autoload
</code>

<code php>
<?php
require __DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php';
require '../helpers.php';
</code>
This code does the job. The autoloader from [[home:php:pkg:composer:|Composer]] searches also in subfolders of namespace corresponding folder. Now we could start

**index.php**
<code php>
<?php
require __DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php';
require '../helpers.php';

$router = new core\Router(); // crappy way because this has to be the full qualified namespace
</code>
To write clean code we should add use statements for better readable and maintainable code
**index.php**
<code php>
<?php
require __DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php';
require '../helpers.php';

use core\Router;
// use PDO;  // if needed

$router = new Router(); // this together with use makes things easier to read
</code>
What we should consider is classmap (**vendor/composer/autoload_classmap.php**) currently we are using [[https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/|PSR-4]] to handle dynamic autoloading for us, whenerver we add a new class under App or Core namespace we don't need to regenerate the autoload file. It will just work because it will just be dynamically loaded for you using psr4 rules and this is the prefered way during development but in production you want things to be as fast as possible, so in the composer directory we see the autoload class map generated file. While [[https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/|PSR-4]] is already fast using class maps is even faster because dynamic autoloading needs to check file system before resolving a class name with classmade bottle loading will load the classes from the generated array and this is why it's called the class map it maps the classes to their locations in our class map (vendor/composer/autoload_classmap.php) though we only have a single element so we don't really have anything mapped yet other than this we can pass an argument to the composer dump autoload to load this array with the classes. So we can do composer dump-autoload -o as argument, this should generate optimized autoloading 
<code bash>
composer dump-autoload -o
</code>
This should retune something like //Generated optimized autoload files containing 154 classes//. If you check **vendor/composer/autoload_classmap.php** now it should populate an array with all the classes that our application needs. If you add new classes then you have to run composer dump-autoload with the optimize option again to add those classes in this array, which is not that ideal for development, you don't want to be running this command every time so that's why using composer dump-autoload for development is just fine but for production you might want to use the composer dump-autoload with the optimize option so that it's a bit faster. Note that if the class is not found in this array then composer will fall back to the psr4 auto loading to load your class. Note that you should not commit vendor directory in your version control system like git for example, instead you should add this to your git ignore file.
===== PHP Class Constants =====

As in the Basics we defined constants before, you could also define constants per class. Constants are immutable meaning that you cannot change the value once it's defined. **Constants can be defined similar to properties**, there agine we follow standard to keep constant names uppercase and use underscores as the separator 
<code php>
<?php
declare(strict_types = 1);
namespace App\PaymentGateway\Paddle;

class Transaction
{
    public const STATUS_DECLINED = 'decliened';
    public const STATUS_PAID     = 'paid';
    public const STATUS_PENDING  = 'pending';
    
    public function __construct()
    {
      
    }
}
</code>
You could also assign access modifiers or visibility to the class constant if you don't by default they will be set to public but it's recommended to always define the visibility even if it's public. In procedural world non-class constants were in global space we could access them by simply referring or using the constant name but to access the class constants we need to **access them using the class name followed by double columns which is called the scope resolution operator and then the constant name**
<code php>
<?php
declare(strict_types = 1);
use App\PaymentGateway\Paddle;
require_once __DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php';

echo Transaction::STATUS_PAID; /* :: Scope resolution operator */
</code>
**Class constants are allocated once per class** and not per instance of the class which means that we **don't need to have the instance of the class to access the class constants** now. In addition to accessing constants on the class level you could actually access them on the object level as well.
<code php>
<?php
declare(strict_types = 1);
use App\PaymentGateway\Paddle;
require_once __DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php';

$transaction = new Transaction();
echo $transaction::STATUS_PAID; /* :: Scope resolution operator */
</code>
If you set the class constant to private you will no longer be able to access that constant outside of the class the same way you wouldn't be able to access the class properties. However you could access them from within the class and to **access constants within the class** you need to use the class name the scope resolution operator (::) and the name of the constant.
<code php>
<?php
declare(strict_types = 1);
namespace App\PaymentGateway\Paddle;

class Transaction
{
    public const STATUS_DECLINED = 'decliened';
    public const STATUS_PAID     = 'paid';
    public const STATUS_PENDING  = 'pending';
    
    public function __construct()
    {
      var_dump(Transaction::STATUS_PAID);
    }
}
</code>
Another way to access it is by using the self keyword and self refers to the current class, so it's similar to the $this variable which refers to the calling object but self refers to the current class or the class where it's called. 
<code php>
<?php
declare(strict_types = 1);
namespace App\PaymentGateway\Paddle;

class Transaction
{
    public const STATUS_DECLINED = 'decliened';
    public const STATUS_PAID     = 'paid';
    public const STATUS_PENDING  = 'pending';
    
    public function __construct()
    {
        var_dump(self::STATUS_PAID);
    }
}
</code>
A class also has a magic constant called class which resolves at compile time and returns a fully qualified class name
<code php>
<?php
declare(strict_types = 1);
use App\PaymentGateway\Paddle;
require_once __DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php';

$transaction = new Transaction();
echo $transaction::class; /* why is it lower case, tell me why */
</code>
This can work on objects and you can work on the class itself. 
<code php>
<?php
echo Transaction::class; 
</code>
There are many use cases for constants, if you have data or information that does not change and keep referencing all over the code it's better to move it into a class constant so that if it ever changes change it in one place. Another use case is to define constants as sort of enumerations or enums. It allow you not to hard code these value. If you notice that you're hard coding some piece of data that does not change that often, consider replacing them with constants.
<code php>
<?php
declare(strict_types = 1);
namespace App\PaymentGateway\Paddle;

class Transaction
{
    public const STATUS_DECLINED = 'declined';
    public const STATUS_PAID     = 'paid';
    public const STATUS_PENDING  = 'pending';
    
    private string $status;
    
    public function __construct()
    {
        $this->status = self::STATUS_PENDING;
    }
    
    public function setStatus(string $status): self
    {
      $this->status = $status;
      return $this;
    }
}
</code>
The following code is setting status to paid, this is all good and it's working. Imagine you would doing this all over your code. You're code essentially hard coding these and you might make a typo or pass something like this and it will still work right and even through this does not cause any errors you might introduce some bugs somewhere else in your code also you could pass any invalid status and it will still work and again this could introduce bugs in another part of your code.
<code php>
<?php
declare(strict_types = 1);
use App\PaymentGateway\Paddle;
require_once __DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php';

$transaction = new Transaction();
$transaction->setStatus('paid');
</code>
This is where constants can hel you. 
<code php>
<?php
declare(strict_types = 1);
use App\PaymentGateway\Paddle;
require_once __DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php';

$transaction = new Transaction();
$transaction->setStatus(Transaction::STATUS_PAID); /* $transaction->setStatus('Oma Meyer'); is ok */
</code>
Now we have solved on problem. The problem we solved is with the typos, now we are passing the constant so we know that we're not going to make typos. However we could still pass any invalid status like Oma Meyer as status and the code would work here. To solve this second case we could simply introduce some kind of validation.
<code php>
<?php
declare(strict_types = 1);
namespace App\PaymentGateway\Paddle;

class Transaction
{
    public const STATUS_DECLINED = 'decliened';
    public const STATUS_PAID     = 'paid';
    public const STATUS_PENDING  = 'pending';
    
    private string $status;
    
    public function __construct()
    {
        $this->status = self::STATUS_PENDING;
    }
    
    public function setStatus(string $status): self
    {
      if ($status === self::STATUS_PAID || $status === self::STATUS_PENDING || $status === self::STATUS_DECLINED ) 
      {
         $this->status = $status;
      } else {
        /* throw some kind of exception or error */
      }
      return $this;
    }
}
</code> 
If status is paid or pending or status is declined then everything is good, otherwise maybe throw an exception or throw some kind of error, but this would be bunch of conditionals here and as you would add more constants and more statuses you would need to modify this method instead of this we could simply introduce another constant called all statuses and set this to an array the keys can be the actual statuses.
<code php>
<?php
declare(strict_types = 1);
namespace App\PaymentGateway\Paddle;

class Transaction
{
    public const STATUS_DECLINED = 'declined';
    public const STATUS_PAID     = 'paid';
    public const STATUS_PENDING  = 'pending';
    
    /* Lookup table */
    public const ALL_STATUSES = [  
        self::STATUS_PAID     => 'Paid',
        self::STATUS_PENDING  => 'Pending',
        self::STATUS_DECLINED => 'Decliened'
    ];
    
    private string $status;
    
    public function __construct()
    {
        $this->status = self::STATUS_PENDING;
    }
    
    public function setStatus(string $status): self
    {
    /* if ($status === self::STATUS_PAID || $status === self::STATUS_PENDING || $status === self::STATUS_DECLINED ) */
      if (! isset(self::ALL_STATUSES[$status]))
      {
         throw new \InvalidArgumentException('Invalid status');
      } 
      $this->status = $status;
      return $this;
    }
}
</code> 
You could actually introduce some kind of friendly name to this status because you already these values available as keys and for the values of this array you could give it a friendly name that you could later use to display to the user. This array can be used as lookup table, the lookup table makes it simple to check if the given status exists in the all statuses array and if it does not exist we can throw some kind of exception or an error. Two problems solved  but there is the one thing bothering, we're kind of coupling these constants within the transaction class. The Transaction class should be responsible for processing and working with transactions and not for storing status constants. It does not make sense to refer to transaction class outside of object to access the constants. Imagine we had to access we this constant somewhere else where transaction wasn't needed maybe for display, referencing a class that has other business logic in it just to get the constant values would not look good in code. 

We could extract all Status constants into its own class, because right now we're prefixing all statuses with the status word. Changing something like self::STATUS_PAID to Status::PAID would look much cleaner and or expressive. 
<code php>
<?php
namespace App\Enums;

class Status
{
    public const DECLINED = 'declined';
    public const PAID     = 'paid';
    public const PENDING  = 'pending';
    
    /* Lookup table */
    public const ALL_STATUSES = [  
        self::PAID     => 'Paid',
        self::PENDING  => 'Pending',
        self::DECLINED => 'Declined'
    ];
}
</code> 
Some small changes, switch from self:: to Status:: and everything still works  
<code php>
<?php
declare(strict_types = 1);
namespace App\PaymentGateway\Paddle;

class Transaction
{  
    private string $status;
    
    public function __construct()
    {
        $this->status = Status::PENDING;
    }
    
    public function setStatus(string $status): self
    {
      if (! isset(Status::ALL_STATUSES[$status]))
      {
         throw new \InvalidArgumentException('Invalid status');
      } 
      $this->status = $status;
      return $this;
    }
}
</code> 
This looks a lot more readable and expressive and we are not coupling our status data with the transaction class. Something to note PHP will be adding native support to enum type so you could create enum classes so you wouldn't need to create a class like the Status class with constants. You would be able to create an enum class, see [[https://wiki.php.net/rfc/enumerations|PHP RFC: Enumerations]]
===== Static Members & Methods =====
You can define your properties and methods to be static using the static keyword. You can put the keyword static before or after the access modifier, as you like, if you following standards you should put it after the access modifier. It is up to you as long as you stay consistent. 
<code php>
<?php
declare(strict_types = 1);
namespace App\PaymentGateway\Paddle;

class Transaction {
  public static int $count = 0; /* or read only? */
  
  public static function getCount(): int {
    return self::$count;
  }
  
  public function __construct(
    public float $amount,
    public string $description
  ) {
    self::count++; /* Transaction ::count++; */
  }
  
  public function process()
  {
     echo 'Processing paddle transaction ...';
  }  
}
</code>
You can access static properties and methods the same way you could access constants using the scope resolution operator (::). The thing is you don't actually need the object to access the static methods and properties of the class because they're not created and they're not associated per object they are created and associated o class basis so they belong to the class itself and not to any particular object or an instance and here as you can see in the following code, this is perfectly valid and it will work. You can access static properties and methods on the object but you don't have to, you could access them on the class itself, the same way you where accessing class constants. If you need to access a static property or method from within the class you could use either the self keyword or you could use the class name as well.
<code php>
<?php
declare(strict_types = 1);
namespace App\PaymentGateway\Paddle\Transaction;
require_once __DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php';

$transaction = new Transaction(25, 'Transaction 1');
var_dump($transaction::$count); /* access on the object */
var_dump(Transaction::$count);  /* access on the class */
</code>
As mentioned static properties and functions are not associated per object, what that means is that the regular class properties every time you create an instance these properties get created and get associated to that specific object, so you could have multiple different transaction objects and each one can have different values for those properties. You can think of static properties as global variables in a way their values are shared across the objects because they're not tied to a particular object or an instance they're tied to the class itself.
<code php>
<?php
declare(strict_types = 1);
namespace App\PaymentGateway\Paddle\Transaction;
require_once __DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php';

$transaction = new Transaction(25,  'Transaction A');
$transaction = new Transaction(50,  'Transaction B');
$transaction = new Transaction(75,  'Transaction C');
$transaction = new Transaction(100, 'Transaction D');
$transaction = new Transaction(125, 'Transaction F');
var_dump(Transaction::$count);  /* access on the class */
</code> 
With each new object $count will increment by 1 that's why we get 5 at the end. As you see the value is shared and it's kind of globally accessible. You don't need an instance of the class, you could simply just access them using the class itself.

If $count would be private we could use getCount() and everything is still working.
<code php>
<?php
declare(strict_types = 1);
namespace App\PaymentGateway\Paddle\Transaction;
require_once __DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php';

$transaction = new Transaction(25,  'Transaction A');
$transaction = new Transaction(50,  'Transaction B');
$transaction = new Transaction(75,  'Transaction C');
$transaction = new Transaction(100, 'Transaction D');
$transaction = new Transaction(125, 'Transaction F');
var_dump(Transaction::getCount());  /* access on the class */
</code> 
Because the access of static methods does not require an instance of the class and because they belong to the class itself and not to a particular object

As a reminder inside the class is the variable $this is not available within the static method, so you cannot do something like echo $this->count; you're going to get a Uncaught Error: Using $this when not in object context, which makes sense because this variable is referring to the calling object but in the case of statics we don't really have an object so instead of using the $this you would use the self keyword or the class name.

Another thing you should be aware of is that if you try to use the scope resolution operator on a non-static property you will also get an Uncaught Error Access to undeclared static property, because the static property with the selected name does not exist we only have the non-static property and you cannot access non-static properties statically and same applies to methods if you try to access a non-static method statically you would also get an error since PHP 8 and prior to PHP 8 you would get a deprecated message.

==== Use cases for Static Members & Methods ====

There are multiple use cases for static properties and static functions that can come across in a developers life.

=== Cache ===
The use of static methods and properties is generally considered a bad practice but there are some use cases where the use of statics can come in handy one use case for static properties is to have some sort of counter or cache values so it can often be used to implement a technique called memorization which can speed up expensive operations by caching the results for later access. 
=== Singleton Pattern ===
You might also come across a code that makes a use of static properties to implement a singleton pattern. A singleton pattern maintains a single instance of a given class throughout your application. The most simples example of the singleton pattern implementation using the static properties and methods 
<code php>
<?php
namespace App;

class DB
{
  public static ?DB $instance = null
  
  private function __constant(public array $config)
  {
     
  }
  
  public static function getInstance(array $config): DB
  {
     if (self::$instance === null) {
       self::$instance = new DB($config);
     }
     return self::$instance;
  }   
}
</code>
We have a static property instance that is nullable but its type is current DB class and it's set to null by default then in the constructor we are accepting configuration or DB credentials or something like that and that's non-static. Notice that the **constructor access modifier of the constructor is set to private**, this means that we cannot directly instantiate this class **$db = new DB();** will not work and we would get an Uncaught Error Call to private from global scope. Because of that we have this **getInstance method** which is a static method and we can call this to get the instance of the db class this again accepts the same arguments as the constructor and checks if the instance is set to null it will set that property to the new instance of the db class and then simply return that instance so **$db = DB::getInstance([]);** and we passed in some config here no matter how many times  we will call that getInstance([]); we will still get the same instance. You might come across a singleton implemented this way but it does not mean it's the right way. Dependency Injection is the right way and will be discussed later.

This is the most basic of the singleton pattern. This is not exactly fully singleton because it does not contain things like clone and other magic methods and the main reason for that is because we haven't covert those magic methods. 
=== Utility Methods ===
Another use case for a static methods would be to create some kind of utility methods that don't really need instance of the class so maybe you had some kind of formatter class that had bunch of methods to format your currency or format the amount or format the percent value and so on and it doesn't really depend on the object. So if those methods are not tied to the object and they don't need the instance of the class and it makes it convenient and makes it convenient for the developer to access then you could use the static methods like **Format::amount(85,43)** and your amount and that would work in that case you don't need the instance of format because is not tied directly to that object. 
=== Factory Pattern ===
Another use case that you might see with static methods is with the factory pattern we we'll talk about the factory design pattern later. The factory pattern is basically responsible for creating objects of other classes and often developers implement it using a static methods, often called make or create. 
<code php>
<?php
$transaction = TransactionFactory::make (25, 'Transaction 1'); /* $transaction = new Transaction(25, 'Transaction 1'); */
</code>
This static make method would be responsible for creating the transaction object, but this is not the right way either, the better way is to use dependency injection again. 

The main reason why the use of static properties and methods is discouraged is that they represent what's called a global state which means that you can modify the data or call the static function from anywhere in the code which can make things harder to maintain and harder to test. There are some very small niche use cases where the use of status could make sense but a lot of times statics are misused and dependency injection should be used instead also some might argue that the use of statics is faster then creating instances of objects which can be true but it's a micro-optimization that in most cases would not matter.

You could access static methods non-statically, as shown below
<code php>
// ...
$transaction = new Transaction(2, 'Transaction 1');
var_dump($transaction->getCount()); /* var_dump($transaction::getCount()); */
</code>
It's not recommended doing this because it's not clear that this method is static and plus you cannot access this variable within this method so it could cause confusion and problems down the road is another thing. 

Another thing is you could have static call backs or closures.
<code php>
// ...
array_map(static function() {
  // ...
}, []);
</code>
The main reason why you would see somebody do this is because when you set the function to static you can no longer access $this variable, for not changing class values accidently. This can cause some unexpected bugs and hard to debug issues. If you add static to the call back function you can be sure that this kind of code will throw an error and not let the developer proceed.

Also another reason why somebody would have static closures or call backs is that it can be a micro-optimisation over the regular function but don't use it only for that micro optimization. 

**Use static closures when you want to make sure that $this variable is not available and accessible in that function.**
===== PHP - object-oriented programming =====

The four principles of object-oriented programming are 
  * Encapsulation
  * Abstraction
  * Inheritance
  * Polymorphism

==== PHP - Encapsulation & Abstraction ====

Encapsulation simply bundles the data and methods, that operate on that data within one unit like a class. As an example it hides the internal representation or the state of the object which protects the integrity of that object.

Encapsulation ensures that your object manages its own state and nothing can change that unless it's explicitly allowed let's take this transaction class as an example here by using access modifier private hide property data from external access, forcing data access outside of this class by anyone interacting via class methods. Private means that the property and method can only be accessed from the class itself. Protected is pretty much the same thing as the private but it extends to the child or the subclasses. 

Public properties can break the encapsulation principle, because anyone interacting with this object outside of the class can now modify the state of our object which could result in nasty bugs. Especially when working in teams, those bugs easily happen, when you were given an object as an  method argument with someone else creating the object given to you. Overriding public properties bugs can happen intentional as misunderstanding or accidental and something somewhere in your code will blow up, you can prevent those bugs by setting properties to private, which will ensure interaction outside of this class will be restricted and might be protected by smart setter methods. 

If you need to access a property of a class you can introduce a public method which is also called the getter method also known as the accessor to retrieve the value of the property. The getter simply returns the property value. If you wanted to change the amount for whatever reason then you could introduce another public method called set amount which is called the setter, which accepts the new value as argument, to update the property where you also could do some quality of input check.
<code php>
<?php
declare(strict_types = 1);
namespace App\PaymentGateway\Paddle;

class Transaction
{
  private float amount = 0;
  
  public function __construct(float $amount) 
  {
    $this->amount = $amount;
  }
  
  public function getAmount(): float
  {
     return $this->amount;
  }
  
  public function setAmount(float $amount): float
  {
     /* check quality of input here */
     $this->amount = $amount;
  }
  
  public function process()
  {
     echo 'Processing ' . $this->amount . ' transaction';
  }
}
</code>
We have the getter and setter methods to access the property, but if we are going to expose the getter and setter method for every property that we have, isn't that pretty much the same thing as having this property as public because right now we have the property set to private but we are exposing these two public methods here which get's the property value and another one mutates the property value. Back now to the original problem calling the setter might be also the same problem we've passed that we change the state of our object. Getters and setter might be used to introduce encapsulation to the class but they can actually cause more harm then good by breaking the encapsulation principle and because of this hear a lot about having getters and setters being the best practice. The way about this is that that if you have a property that represent the state of the object, make them private and make sure that you don't have another method that changes that state of the object. Instead accept the value through the constructor or through the method that we call instead of the setter. If you need to change the value without having a setter consider creating a new object, so don't need to mutate this object. If you don't need to get the value of a property consider not to implement a getter only as a default developer behaviour. 

There are cases of course where the getters and setters make sense, in some cases you might have some additional logic that you perform before you set the property or before you get the property like some validation or formatting for example and so on. In those cases then setters and getters do make sense also with setters you can do method chaining where kind of build up your object by calling bunch of methods which gives you this fluent interface and you'll see that as a common practice, in some cases it's also perfectly fine to have public properties and you'll see them be used in popular frameworks so there are definitely some use cases one use case is for **data transfer objects or in short dtos** which we'll cover later. Advice here would be to not define getter and setter methods for every single property unless and until you actually need them. The point is don't just create setters and getters because you have a property. In addition to protecting your properties you might also have some methods that are not meant to be exposed or publicly available they might be internal implementation so you would want to hide those as well so for example within a process method we might be calling some other methods and they should not be set to public. 
=== PHP - PHP Reflection API ===
There is still a way to break encapsulation and access private and protected properties and methods through the PHP Reflection API. If you have a private property like $amount in the following code
<code php>
<?php
declare(strict_types = 1);
namespace App\PaymentGateway\Paddle;

class Transaction
{
  private float $amount = 0;
  
  // ...
}
</code>
You will get an Fatal Error if you try to access restricted properties and methods. You can actually still get the access to those restricted properties and methods through something called PHP's Reflection API. If you try to access the amount property which is private you would get the Uncaught Error Cannot access private property. 
<code php>
<?php
declare(strict_types = 1);
use App\PaymentGateway\Paddle\Transaction;
require_once __DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php';
$transaction = new Transaction( 25, 'Transaction 1');
echo $transaction->amount; 
</code>
Now trying to access this private property using the reflection api as a basic preview. The PHP reflection api basically just adds the the ability to introspect your classes so we could do something like 
$reflectionProperty = new ReflectionProperty(class, property) 
and the first argument we pass the full qualified class name and the second argument is the property name in the this case below amount. Now we can setAccessible to true, now this does not make this amount property directly accessible on the transaction object we'll still get the fatal error but now we can do something like 
var_dump($reflectionProperty->getValue()) on the object which we're getting that value and that is $transaction
<code php>
<?php
declare(strict_types = 1);
use App\PaymentGateway\Paddle\Transaction;
require_once __DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php';
$transaction = new Transaction( 25, 'Transaction 1');
$reflectionProperty = new ReflectionProperty(Transaction::class, 'amount');
$reflectionProperty->setAccessible(true);
var_dump($reflectionProperty->getValue($transaction));
</code>
Now we can access the private property can we modify that private property the answer is yes we can. We can do something like this reflection property setValue and we pass the transaction object as the first argument and second argument would be the actual amount.  
<code php>
<?php
declare(strict_types = 1);
use App\PaymentGateway\Paddle\Transaction;
require_once __DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php';
$transaction = new Transaction( 25, 'Transaction 1');
$reflectionProperty = new ReflectionProperty(Transaction::class, 'amount');
$reflectionProperty->setAccessible(true);
$reflectionProperty->setValue($transaction, 125);
var_dump($reflectionProperty->getValue($transaction));
</code>
So as you can see we're not really restricting anything by setting properties and methods to private or protected but the point of private and protected access modifiers is to let the one know interacting with the object that certain properties and methods are meant to be kept private or protected they are internal implantations and they are meant to be used within that class don't worry to much about this because in most cases it would not matter. here it was only about the trick how you could actually access  private and protected properties and methods. You probably wouldn't actually do this in a real application.
=== PHP - Abstraction ===
There are different ways to interpret the term abstraction and some refer to abstraction as abstract classes and methods but abstraction principle from the four principles of object-oriented programming refers to a different concept and is not the same as abstract classes and methods.

You could implement abstraction using abstract classes and methods but it's not the same thing. Abstraction is actually closer and goes hand in hand with encapsulation instead of abstract classes and methods we'll cover abstract classes and methods later but abstraction simply means that internal implementation details of an object are hidden from the user you could call a method on the object maybe provide some input and maybe get an output but you don't care how the method is actually implemented and how it works behind the scenes all you care about is that you call it and you expect some kind of output or some kind of result. If we call a method we don't care what goes on behind the scenes, we don't care how it connects to something, we don't care how it's saved in the database, we don't care if it sends an email or not and we don't care how it generates the receipt all we. We care about is that we process the transaction this is what abstraction is in simple terms. You're basically hiding the implementation details from the user. The point is that the place where you call a method that does not and should not care what goes on within that method and any changes to the method should not affect other pards of the code setting properties to public would break the encapsulation it also breaks abstraction because if you change the definition your code blow up on multiple different places or you will have some unexpected results because you're directly accessing this property. If you try to build your classes in a way way that does not break encapsulation and does not break abstraction you will be on track on achieving a good object-oriented design. 

There is a question that you could ask yourself when building your classes, can you make changes to this class without breaking too  many things outside of this class. If the answer is yes then you have a well-designed class and maintaining and extending that code base and that class will be much easier so what's the difference between encapsulation and abstraction because they have some things in common. The encapsulation hides the internal state or the information while the obstruction hides the actual implementation of it.

There are some use cases for public properties and setters and getters just keep encapsulation and abstraction principles in mind when designing and building out your classes. Note that classes of the same type can actually access each other's private and protected properties and methods. 
<code php>
  public function copyFrom(Transaction $transaction)
  {
     var_dump($transaction->amount);
  }
</code>

==== PHP - Inheritance ====
Inheritance allows you to have a class that is derived from another class which also is referred to as parent child classes where the parent is the base class that you derive from the child class will inherit the public and protected methods and properties which then can be overridden in addition to inheriting these in the child class you could of course also have additional properties bas constants and methods we're going to cover few examples here the first example simulating a toaster
<code php>
<?php
class Toaster
{
  public array $slices = [];
  public int   $size   = 2;
  
  public function addSlice(string $slice): void
  {
     if (count($this->slice) < $this->size) 
     {
        $this->slices[] = $slice;
     }
  }
  
  public function toast()
  {
     foreach($this->slices as $i => $slice)
     {
        echo ($i + 1) . ': Toasting ' . $slice . PHP_EOL;
     }
  }
}
</code>

<code php>
<?php
use App\Toaster;
require_once __DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php';

$toaster = new Toaster();

$toaster->addSlice('bread');
$toaster->addSlice('bread');
$toaster->addSlice('bread');
$toater->toast();
</code>
Toasting two slices even through we have added three slices, because the maximum slices this toaster can toast is two. The ideal way would be to throw an exception here if we reach the maximum number of slices.

Lets imagine we want to simulate another more advanced toaster that has an bit more functionality and more features, let's say it's the pro version of the original toaster, instead of toasting only two slices of bread at the same time the pro version can toast four slices at the same time and in addition to having the basic toasting abilities it also has the preset to toast it as the bagel  
<code php>
<?php
class ToasterPro
{
  public array $slices = [];
  public int   $size   = 4;
  
  public function addSlice(string $slice): void
  {
     if (count($this->slice) < $this->size) 
     {
        $this->slices[] = $slice;
     }
  }
  
  public function toast()
  {
     foreach($this->slices as $i => $slice)
     {
        echo ($i + 1) . ': Toasting ' . $slice . PHP_EOL;
     }
  }
  
  public function toastBagle()
  {
     foreach($this->slices as $i => $slice)
     {
        echo ($i + 1) . ': Toasting ' . $slice . ' with bagels option' . PHP_EOL;
     }
  }
}
</code>
The addSlice and toast methods are identical in Toaster and ToasterPro that's because TosterPro "is a" Toaster. Notice the relationship Toaster Pro is a Toaster, which means that it can toast bread, with the regular basic settings but it could also toast bread with the bagel option setting and it can toast four slices at the same time instead of two so because of this we can leverage the power of inheritance and **inherit the toaster class in our toaster pro** and we can do that by using the **extends keyword**. and now it extends toaster inherits toaster pro all the public and protected methods properties and constants of the toaster class, so if nothing to change we can remove the duplicate code in ToasterPro class. 
<code php>
<?php
class ToasterPro extends Toaster
{
  public int   $size   = 4;
  
  public function toastBagle()
  {
     foreach($this->slices as $i => $slice)
     {
        echo ($i + 1) . ': Toasting ' . $slice . ' with bagels option' . PHP_EOL;
     }
  }
}
</code>
As mentioned before we are able to overwrite public and protected properties and methods and that is exactly what we're doing here we're overriding the size property with the value of four because toaster pro can toast four slices at the same time while the toaster can only do two.
<code php>
<?php
use App\Toaster;
require_once __DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php';

$toaster = new ToasterPro();

$toaster->addSlice('bread');
$toaster->addSlice('bread');
$toaster->addSlice('bread');
$toaster->addSlice('bread');
$toater->toast();
</code>





<code php>
<?php
class Admin extends User {
  private $level;
  
  // Constructor
  public function __construct($name, $email, $level) {
    echo 'Admin Constructor ran ... <br />'; 
    $this->level = $level;
    parent::__construct($name, $email);
  }
  
  // Getter & Setter

===== Abstract Classes =====

Abstract Classes are
  * incomplete
  * at least partially incomplete
  * we cannot instantiate then
  * if a class has a abstract method, the class must be marked abstract too
  * common in parent classes

<code php>
abstract class Shape {
  protected $name;
  
  abstract public function calculate();
  
  // Constrictor
  public function __construct($name) {
    $this->name = $name;
  } 

  // Concrete methods
  public function getName() {
    return $this->name;
  }
}


class Circle extends Shape {
  private $radius;

  public function __construct($name, $radius) {
    parent::__construct($name);
    $this->radius= $radius;
  }
  public function calculate(){
    return pi() * pow($this->radius, 2); // r^2
  }
}

$circle = new Circle('Circle', 5);
var_dump($circle); 


class Rectangle extends Shape {
  private $width;
  private $height;

  public function __construct($name, $width, $height) {
    parent::__construct($name);
    $this->width = $width;
    $this->height= $height;
  }
  public function calculate(){
    return $this->width * $this->height;
  }
}

$rectangle = new Rectangle ('Rectangle ', 4, 6);
var_dump($rectangle); 
</code>


===== Catch Errors =====
  * **Exception** Base class for all exceptions
  * **Error** Base class for all internal PHP errors
  * **TypeError** Raised when a function argument or return value has the wrong type
  * **ParseError** Raised when there is a syntax error in evaluated code (e.g. eval)
  * **ArgumentCountError** Raised when too few arguments are passed to a function
  * **ArithmeticError** Raised when an invalid arithmetic operation occurs (e.g. division by zero with intdiv)
  * **DivisionByZeroError** Raised specifically when dividing by zero
  * **UnhandledMatchError** Raised when a `match` expression has no matching arm
